# BookBreeze
BookBreeze is an innovative e-commerce platform designed with meticulous attention to detail over six comprehensive project deadlines. Initially, the project defined its scope and business requirements, followed by crafting an ER Diagram and Relationship Model. The third phase focused on establishing a robust database schema with SQL tables, ensuring integrity constraints and data population integrity. Subsequent stages involved crafting and executing diverse SQL queries showcasing relational algebraic operations and constraints, as well as developing embedded SQL applications for ordering and inventory analysis, complete with triggers for database condition monitoring. The final deadline culminated in implementing and testing database transactions, both non-conflicting and conflicting, alongside a user-friendly interface and comprehensive user guide.
